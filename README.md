# WebAPICodeQuiz

## Ryan's Web API Code Quiz

* This project was the most difficult that I have attempted in bootcamp, I did employ help from tutors. I know that this project is falling far below acceptance criteria. Enjoy...


* I struggled significantly with getting the questions and the answers to show on the appropriate page and am aware that it is riddled with errors in the console log. Although the questions do move forward in the console log, just not on the actual page.

* As I was unable to accomplish the above; I did not have time to address further criteria like the timer and the local storage of initials.
